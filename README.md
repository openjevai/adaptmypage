<p align="center"><strong>Semantic feature flags for websites, powered by Jev.</strong><br/>
Your site knows what visitors clicked. Now it can know what they’re trying to do.</p>

```tsx
const technical = useIntent("technical_evaluation");
if (technical.confidence > 0.8) return <TechnicalHero />;
```

This repository holds the open-source SDK and the landing page that runs it on itself.

> **OpenJEV support:** Jev is built by [TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai). This fork keeps TypeSafe as the default and adds optional support for [OpenJEV](https://openjev.sh), a free community gateway to the same Jev model — set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` (or `JEV_PROVIDER=openjev`) to use it. Original project: https://github.com/bvicsay/adaptmypage by @bvicsay.

| path | what |
| --- | --- |
| [`packages/adaptmypage`](packages/adaptmypage) | The npm package: React hooks, `<Intent>`, vanilla core, server handler, Jev client, heuristic fallback, tests |
| [`apps/web`](apps/web) | The landing page and the live demos (Next.js 16). `/demo/<id>` shows the same page for two visitors side by side with a change log; `/demo/<id>/frame` is the page itself |

## Demos

Four real pages, each with its own route and custom Jev questions, in [`apps/web/src/demos`](apps/web/src/demos):

| demo | brand | what changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pricing` | Relay | Comparison table for comparers, trial button for buyers, SSO/SOC 2 block for procurement, "recommended" badge from `team_size` |
| `product` | Ando | The one reassurance the shopper needs from `concern` (fit, shipping, price, durability), specs up front for runners, sticky buy bar |
| `docs` | Vex OCR | Right language tab from `integration_target`, guided vs reference depth from expertise, one comparison card from `deciding_factor` |
| `signup` | Ledgerly | Shorter form on friction, blocker-specific reassurance from `blocker`, CLI for developers, finish-later link on abandon risk |

Each demo is a folder with `config.ts` (site context, questions, scripted personas, code shown in the hub) and `Page.tsx` (the page, using the SDK hooks). Scripted personas replay through the real API, so every change on screen is a real judgment.

## How it works

1. **Observe.** The SDK collects semantic events in the browser: sections entering the viewport, dwell, hovers over controls, copied code, form activity, exit intent, rage clicks. No coordinates, keystrokes or field values.
2. **Judge.** Every few seconds a compact snapshot goes to one route. The route sends it to [Jev](https://vercel.com/i/what-is-jev) (TypeSafe AI's decision model) with six typed questions and gets probabilities back in one 70–500 ms pass.
3. **Act.** Your code reads the answer like any other flag.

Measured on this site through OpenRouter: six answers in ~300–500 ms for ~1,700 input tokens, about $0.00007 per judgment.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:sdk          # builds packages/adaptmypage → dist
pnpm dev                # builds the SDK, then runs the site at http://localhost:3000
pnpm test               # SDK unit tests (vitest + jsdom)
pnpm typecheck
```

Copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env` and set **one** Jev credential:

```bash
TYPESAFE_API_KEY=…      # direct: https://typesafe.ai
# or
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=…    # https://vercel.com/ai-gateway/models/jev
# or
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=…    # https://openrouter.ai/typesafe
# or
OPENJEV_API_KEY=…       # https://openjev.sh — free community gateway to Jev
```

Without a key the API route answers with a transparent rules-based evaluator and every response is labelled `source: "heuristic"`. The live panel shows which one answered.

For the email list set `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID`, or `SUBSCRIBE_WEBHOOK_URL`. In development with neither set, sign-ups append to `apps/web/.data/subscribers.jsonl`.

While editing the SDK and the site together, run `pnpm --filter adaptmypage dev` in a second terminal so `dist/` rebuilds on save.

## Deploy the site

The site is a standard Next.js app. On Vercel:

1. Import the repository, set **Root Directory** to `apps/web`.
2. Build command `pnpm --filter adaptmypage build && pnpm --filter web build` (or leave the default and set the root `build` script) and install command `pnpm install`.
3. Add the environment variables above plus `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain`.

## Publish the SDK

```bash
cd packages/adaptmypage
npm login
pnpm publish --access public     # runs typecheck + tests + build first
```

Bump `version` in `packages/adaptmypage/package.json` before each release.
